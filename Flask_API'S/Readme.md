# Flask API Examples

This repository contains a collection of simple Flask API examples to help you learn and practice various aspects of building RESTful APIs with Flask. These examples cover different scenarios, from basic greetings to database interactions and token-based authentication.

## Learning Purpose

This project is developed for educational purposes as I explore and deepen my understanding of Flask and RESTful API development. I am leveraging various online resources, tutorials, and documentation to grasp the concepts and implement different functionalities.

Feel free to explore and modify these examples to suit your learning needs. As I continue to learn and experiment, I plan to enhance and expand this collection with additional features and improvements.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the online resources, tutorials, and documentation that have been valuable references in the development of these examples. Learning from the community and leveraging existing knowledge has been an essential part of this learning journey.

**Happy Coding!**
