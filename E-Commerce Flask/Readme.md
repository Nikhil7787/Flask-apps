## Project Status and Future Plans

This project is developed for educational purposes, as a way to learn and practice web development with Flask. It's an ongoing project, and I plan to continue building and improving it over time. While the current version serves as a basic e-commerce website, I have a list of features and enhancements I intend to add in the future.

### Future Plans

- [ ] Implement user authentication for personalized experiences.
- [ ] Add a product search functionality.
- [ ] Improve the design and user interface.
- [ ] Integrate with a database for storing product information.
- [ ] Implement a checkout system and payment processing.
- [ ] ... and much more!

Feel free to contribute, suggest features, or report issues. Your input is highly appreciated as I continue to develop and enhance this project.
